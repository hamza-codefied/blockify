# CSV File Generation

## Students CSV (1000+ students)

To generate the students CSV with 1000+ students distributed across 12 grades, run:

```bash
cd frontend/blockify/docs/test-data
python generate_students_csv.py

- 1000+ students total
- Approximately 83-84 students per grade (grades 1-4: 83 each, grades 5-12: 84 each)
- All required fields: fullName, email, gradeLevel, phone, address, zipcode, guardian info, status
- Unique emails and phone numbers for each student
